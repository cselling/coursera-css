            Turmoil has engulfed the
            Galactic Republic. The taxation
            of trade routes to outlying star
            systems is in dispute.

            Hoping to resolve the matter
            with a blockade of deadly
            battleships, the greedy Trade
            Federation has stopped all
            shipping to the small planet
            of Naboo.

            While the Congress of the
            Republic endlessly debates
            this alarming chain of events,
            the Supreme Chancellor has
            secretly dispatched two Jedi
            Knights, the guardians of
            peace and justice in the
            galaxy, to settle the conflict.…<br><br>

            There is unrest in the Galactic
            Senate. Several thousand solar
            systems have declared their
            intentions to leave the Republic.

            This separatist movement,
            under the leadership of the
            mysterious Count Dooku, has
            made it difficult for the limited
            number of Jedi Knights to maintain
            peace and order in the galaxy.

            Senator Amidala, the former
            Queen of Naboo, is returning
            to the Galactic Senate to vote
            on the critical issue of creating
            an ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC
            to assist the overwhelmed
            Jedi….<br><br>
                    
                    War! The Republic is crumbling
            under attacks by the ruthless
            Sith Lord, Count Dooku.
            There are heroes on both sides.
            Evil is everywhere.

            In a stunning move, the
            fiendish droid leader, General
            Grievous, has swept into the
            Republic capital and kidnapped
            Chancellor Palpatine, leader of
            the Galactic Senate.

            As the Separatist Droid Army
            attempts to flee the besieged
            capital with their valuable
            hostage, two Jedi Knights lead a
            desperate mission to rescue the
            captive Chancellor.…<br><br>
        
            It is a period of civil war.
            Rebel spaceships, striking
            from a hidden base, have won
            their first victory against
            the evil Galactic Empire.

            During the battle, Rebel
            spies managed to steal secret
            plans to the Empire's
            ultimate weapon, the DEATH
            STAR, an armored space
            station with enough power to
            destroy an entire planet.

            Pursued by the Empire's
            sinister agents, Princess
            Leia races home aboard her
            starship, custodian of the
            stolen plans that can save
            her people and restore
            freedom to the galaxy.…<br><br>
            
            It is a dark time for the
            Rebellion. Although the Death
            Star has been destroyed,
            Imperial troops have driven the
            Rebel forces from their hidden
            base and pursued them across
            the galaxy.

            Evading the dreaded Imperial
            Starfleet, a group of freedom
            fighters led by Luke Skywalker
            has established a new secret
            base on the remote ice world
            of Hoth.

            The evil lord Darth Vader,
            obsessed with finding young
            Skywalker, has dispatched
            thousands of remote probes into
            the far reaches of space.…<br><br>

            Luke Skywalker has returned to
            his home planet of Tatooine in
            an attempt to rescue his
            friend Han Solo from the
            clutches of the vile gangster
            Jabba the Hutt.

            Little does Luke know that the
            GALACTIC EMPIRE has secretly
            begun construction on a new
            armored space station even
            more powerful than the first
            dreaded Death Star.

            When completed, this ultimate
            weapon will spell certain doom
            for the small band of rebels
            struggling to restore freedom
            to the galaxy…
